the result of correlation is 
a quite different from sac
result, but our result is 
the same as the brute force
one, so it must be reasonable.
The same situation is true for convolve.

The hilbert transform is just 
the sac hilbert adding a negative sign.

The envelope is the same except that
our result is a little smoother.
