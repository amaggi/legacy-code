        <h3>Welcome to my legacy code pages.</h3>

<p>Over the past few years, I've written a lot of code for a lot of different research projects.  Keeping track of all this code was a nightmare, and I'm sure I've lost quite a lot of it already. </p>

<p>I've decided to put everything I still have hanging around in this git repository, where at least it will be accessible, and might even be useful at some point.</p>

<p>This (of course) is just a proto-webpage.  As more code gets added, it will be updated (yeah, seriously)...</p>
