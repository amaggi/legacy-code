X window version of niceplot

Danny Harvey, August 1990, University of Colorado

This version of niceplot provides full interactive X11 windows capability
plus high resolution postscript output. These FORTRAN callable subroutines
fork an X window plotting daemon program, nxplotd which must be available in
the user's path. The plotting daemon is responsible for repairing the window
and servicing the X event stream and the program runs concurrently with the
user's program. This allows for simple tty-based command driven user interfaces
without the programmer being required to learn about X-window toolkits and
notifier based mouse driven interfaces.

An optional high resolution postscript output file can be produced (see
subroutine initt) which mimics the visual display.

All fonts used by these subroutines are the vector Hershey fonts and a
binary font file must be made available. The path to this font file must
be specified in the subroutine cfont at compile time. An ASCII version of this
font file is available from D. Harvey along with a program, readfont, which
will read the ASCII file and produce the binary file.
