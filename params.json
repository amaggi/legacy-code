{"body":"### Welcome to my legacy code pages.\r\nOver the past few years, I've written a lot of code for a lot of different research projects.  Keeping track of all this code was a nightmare, and I'm sure I've lost quite a lot of it already. \r\n\r\nI've decided to put everything I still have hanging around in this git repository, where at least it will be accessible, and might even be useful at some point.\r\n\r\nThis (of course) is just a proto-webpage.  As more code gets added, it will be updated (yeah, seriously)...\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
